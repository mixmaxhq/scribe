       *    Can be `null` or `undefined` to manually trigger 'content-changed'
       *    and record undo items.
       * @param {string=} recordMode - Whether and how to record undo items
       *    before and after running the transaction; one of the following:
       *      - 'push': Records an undo item before running the transaction,
       *        if the state was dirty, and records another undo item after
       *        running the transaction.
       *      - 'replace': Records an undo item before running the transaction,
       *        if the state was dirty, and replaces the current undo item after
       *        running the transaction.
       *      - 'skip': Does not record undo items, neither before nor after
       *        running the transaction.
       *    Defaults to `push`. This is ignored if _transaction_ is nestedâ€“-the
       *    value for the root transaction determines whether the state will be
       *    recorded or not when the stack unwinds.
